Project Instructions


index.html Main HTML file.

main.js: This is the file you will do all of your work in

data.js: This file contains the data you'll work with

logger.js: This file helps log out the data to the console

Feel free to peek in the data and logger file, but you'll do all of your work in the main.js file. They have also already been properly linked up for you in the index.html file, so open that in Chrome to get started.


Please note that the answers below must be identical when you open up your developer console and view the logged out data.

Since it will be logged out, please use console.log() statements in each of the functions to output the data. Also don't worry about calling the function, the logger file will do that for you.
